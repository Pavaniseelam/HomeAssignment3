Evaluating using MSE and RÂ²

Plotting regression line vs data

Q3 â€“ Classification (Logistic Regression)

Training logistic regression

Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

ROC curve and AUC

Q4 â€“ k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

Training a kNN classifier

Hyperparameter tuning (k value)

Performance visualization
